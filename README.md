Posh-Winfetch is a command-line system information utility written in PowerShell for Windows. Posh-Winfetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an way similar to Neofetch. But this one is little more enhanced than original Winfetch. The original [Winfetch](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch) can be found here. I basically took the Winfetch and built it the way I like.
